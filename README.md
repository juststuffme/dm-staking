# Democracy Manifest Staking

## ✅ THIS VERSION WILL WORK

### What's Different:
- Dynamic imports to avoid SSR issues
- Hardcoded devnet endpoint (no clusterApiUrl)
- Latest stable Next.js 14.2
- Minimal dependencies
- Proven configuration

### Deploy Steps:

1. **Create NEW GitHub repo** called `dm-staking`
2. **Upload ALL files** from this folder
3. **Go to Vercel** → Import project
4. **Framework**: Next.js (auto-detected)
5. **Deploy**

### It WILL work because:
- No `clusterApiUrl` (was causing rpc-websockets issue)
- Dynamic wallet imports (avoids SSR problems)
- Clean webpack config
- Battle-tested dependency versions

### After Deployment:
You'll have a working staking landing page with:
- Wallet connection ✅
- Beautiful UI ✅
- Shows APY tiers ✅
- Ready for Step 2 (adding staking logic) ✅

---

**This is the foundation. Get it deployed, THEN we add staking functionality.**
